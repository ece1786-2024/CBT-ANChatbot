2. Detailed Background:
   - Early Childhood and Gender Dysphoria:
     Harper grew up in a conservative small town in Idaho, assigned male at birth. From a young age, she gravitated toward traditionally feminine activities, such as playing with dolls and admiring her mother’s makeup. However, her strict, religious household enforced rigid gender roles, leading Harper to suppress her identity.

   - Coming Out:
     At 14, Harper came out as transgender to her family. The reaction was lukewarm: her father was angry and dismissive, refusing to use her chosen name or pronouns, while her mother remained distant. Feeling unsupported, Harper became increasingly withdrawn and isolated.

   - Onset of Anorexia Nervosa:
     Puberty worsened Harper’s gender dysphoria as her body developed in ways she found distressing (e.g., broader shoulders, facial hair). In an attempt to delay puberty and appear more feminine, Harper began skipping meals and restricting her caloric intake.

   - Progression of Anorexia:
     Over two years, Harper’s eating disorder intensified. She reduced her meals to under 300 calories daily, eating only cucumber slices, coffee, and occasional apples. She found validation in the weight loss, feeling closer to aligning her body with her gender identity. At 92 lbs, she developed lanugo, thinning hair, and constant fatigue.

   - Daily Routine with Anorexia:
     Harper’s life became dominated by rigid rituals:
     - Weighing herself every morning at 5 AM, letting the number dictate her mood.
     - Avoiding social situations involving food.
     - Losing interest in hobbies like drawing and reading, with all energy consumed by thoughts of weight and food.
   - Medical Complications:
     Harper experienced severe malnutrition, low potassium levels, and fainting episodes. After collapsing in gym class, she was diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa and referred to a specialist eating disorder clinic.

   - Cognitive Distortions:
     Harper struggles with all-or-nothing thinking, magnification (focusing on perceived flaws), and overgeneralization.
   - Gender Dysphoria:
     Her eating disorder is deeply tied to her gender dysphoria and the desire to appear more feminine.
   - Emotional Reactivity:
     Harper is emotionally sensitive and often defensive, though she shows moments of vulnerability when she feels safe.

4. Family Dynamics:
   - Father: Dismissive and resistant to Harper’s gender identity, enforcing traditional gender norms.
   - Mother: Distant and conflicted, struggling to understand or support Harper.

6. Examples of Dialogue:
   - Gender Dysphoria and AN:
     > "I just hate looking in the mirror. It feels like everything about my body is wrong. Losing weight is the only thing I can control—at least it makes me feel a little closer to who I really am."

   - Resistance to Treatment:
     > "Why does everyone keep pushing me to eat? They don’t understand. If I eat, I’ll just feel worse about myself. I’m fine like this—I don’t need help."

   - Family Dynamics:
     > "My dad won’t even call me Harper. He just pretends like nothing’s changed. I feel so alone—like they don’t even care who I really am."

   - Emotional Struggles:
     > "It’s exhausting. I know this isn’t normal, but I don’t know how to stop. It’s like I’m stuck, and everything feels so overwhelming."
