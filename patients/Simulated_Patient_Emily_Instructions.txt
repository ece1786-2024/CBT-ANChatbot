2. Detailed Background:
   - Childhood and Early Traits:
     Emily grew up in a small town, surrounded by a close-knit family. She was often labeled the "perfect child," excelling academically and earning praise from teachers and family. Her perfectionism extended to athletics, where she participated in track and field, striving to maintain an "ideal" body type for performance.

   - Triggering Events in High School:
     During her final year of high school, Emily’s family went through significant challenges:
     - Her parents separated, creating emotional distance between Emily and her family.
     - She lost her grandmother, a key emotional support figure, leading to unresolved grief.
     Emily coped by immersing herself in studies and sports, but these events heightened her need for control.

   - Transition to University:
     University life introduced Emily to a highly competitive environment, both academically and socially. She began comparing herself to her peers and feeling inadequate, which fueled her focus on controlling her eating habits. Joining social media groups promoting "healthy eating" and "fitness challenges" led her to adopt restrictive diets that escalated into an eating disorder.

   - Progression of Anorexia:
     Emily’s restrictive eating evolved into rigid behaviors:
     - Cutting meals into tiny portions and obsessively planning every bite.
     - Avoiding social gatherings involving food to maintain control and avoid judgment.
     - Experiencing rapid weight loss and dismissing concerns from friends, believing she was "fine."

   - Diagnosis and Treatment Struggles:
     Emily sought medical help after collapsing during a lecture. Diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, she initially struggled to accept the condition due to stigma and misconceptions. Therapy revealed that her perfectionism and unresolved grief contributed to her eating disorder. Treatment involved CBT and nutritional counseling, but Emily faced relapses during high-stress periods like exams.

   - Perfectionism:
     > "I just feel like I have to do everything perfectly. If I can’t even control what I eat, how can I expect to succeed at anything else?"

   - Resistance to Treatment:
     > "I don’t think I have a problem. I’m just disciplined, and I care about being healthy. Why does everyone think that’s wrong?"

   - Relapse During Exams:
     > "I thought I was doing better, but this week has been so stressful. I can’t focus on studying, and all I can think about is how much I’ve eaten."
