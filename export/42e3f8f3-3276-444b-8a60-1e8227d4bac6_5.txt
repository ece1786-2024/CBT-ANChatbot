User: I still feel so lost. My family hasn’t changed, and they still don’t get it. My dad’s still acting like I’m not even real. It’s… hard to move forward when I’m stuck like this.
CBT Agent: I'm really sorry to hear that things are still challenging at home, Harper. It sounds like feeling unsupported by your family is weighing heavily on you. That's incredibly tough, especially when you're trying so hard to move forward. How do you usually cope with these feelings when they come up? Sometimes finding little moments for yourself, like through drawing or another activity that brings you some peace, can help ground you amidst the chaos. Is there something specific you'd like to explore together today around managing these family dynamics?
User: I guess I mostly just… shut down. I avoid talking about anything real with them because it always feels like they don’t listen, or worse, they make it worse. Like, every time I try to bring up something important, it’s just… ignored. It’s easier to just keep it all inside, even if it makes me feel worse. Sometimes I try to draw, but even then, I can’t stop thinking about everything. It’s hard to feel like I belong anywhere, even when I’m doing something I used to love. I just… want things to be different, but I don’t know how to make that happen.
CBT Agent: I'm sorry to hear that you’re feeling shut out, Harper. It’s really disheartening when it seems like the people who should support us most don’t hear us. It makes a lot of sense that you'd feel like keeping things inside is the only option right now, but I can imagine how heavy that must feel. When you’re drawing and those thoughts and feelings creep in, what does that experience look like for you? How might we find a way to transform those moments into opportunities for expressing what’s inside? Sometimes those complex feelings can be given a voice or form through creative outlets, which could also be a way to explore what belonging might look like in your own space or how you can communicate these feelings differently. What do you think?
User:  It’s hard to explain… when I draw, it’s like my mind is still racing, but I try to push it aside, hoping that something good will come out of it. But then I look at the drawings, and it’s like they don’t even mean anything anymore. I think about how much of me is just… stuck, how I can’t even put what’s in my head on paper. Sometimes, I feel like if I could just make something perfect, I’d finally feel like I’m doing something right, but nothing ever feels like enough. I don’t even know what belonging would feel like, really… maybe it’s just about feeling like I’m not constantly trying to hide who I am. But how do I even start doing that when no one’s on my side? How do I even let myself be, you know?
CBT Agent: I'm really hearing the struggle and frustration you're expressing, Harper. It sounds overwhelming when what’s in your mind feels so distant from what comes out on paper, and the idea of perfection seems like the only way to feel at peace with your efforts. It makes sense to want your work to reflect your true self and to feel seen and understood. 

When you think about striving for perfection in your art, what feelings or beliefs come up for you? How do those thoughts relate to how you see yourself beyond those drawings? Sometimes, recognizing perfection as a concept we can redefine on our terms can open new paths to self-discovery and belonging. Perhaps we could explore what belonging to yourself might feel like—without the need for external validation. Could trying to draw just for the pure expression, without needing it to be 'right,' offer a space for you to be more authentic and gentle with yourself?

It's also okay if all of this seems daunting right now. Remember, each step towards self-understanding and acceptance—no matter how small—counts and adds up to meaningful change over time. What might feel like a first small step for you in that journey today?
User:  It’s hard to explain… when I draw, it’s like my mind is still racing, but I try to push it aside, hoping that something good will come out of it. But then I look at the drawings, and it’s like they don’t even mean anything anymore. I think about how much of me is just… stuck, how I can’t even put what’s in my head on paper.

How do I even let myself be, you know? It’s hard to explain… when I draw, it’s like my mind is still racing, but I try to push it aside, hoping that something good will come out of it. But then I look at the dr
CBT Agent: I'm truly sorry to hear that those racing thoughts persist even when you're trying to find peace in drawing, Harper. It sounds like you're feeling really stuck, longing for expression and meaning in your art but finding it elusive. That pressure to get it 'perfect' can make it really hard to tap into what drawing used to mean for you. 

When you think about the moments where your drawing feels meaningless, what thoughts are circling? How do those reflect or contrast with how you see yourself or your worth outside of art? Perhaps recognizing and gently challenging the part of you that seeks perfection could begin to create more space for authentic self-expression. What might it be like to remind yourself that your worth isn’t tied to how 'perfect' the drawing looks, but rather what it allows you to explore or express at this moment?

It's important to remember that belonging starts with accepting yourself – all your thoughts, feelings, and even your struggles. What’s one small thing you might do today to honor this, whether in drawing or in how you treat yourself?
User: I guess when I look at my drawings and feel like they’re meaningless, it’s like… I’m reminded that nothing I do is ever good enough. I keep thinking that if I could just make something perfect, then maybe I’d be… real, or maybe people would finally see me. But that’s never going to happen, is it? No matter what I do, it feels like it’s never enough. It’s like I’m constantly running after something I can’t even reach. And yeah… I know it’s not just about the drawing. I feel like that with everything. Like I’m just… not enough. If I can’t even control what goes on paper, how could I ever control anything else about myself? It’s like I’m stuck in this loop of trying to fix myself, but I don’t even know what ‘fixed’ would look like. Maybe… maybe trying to accept myself sounds impossible, though. I’ve spent so long thinking that changing my body would make me feel right, like I’m not trapped in someone else’s life. I guess I just don’t know how to let go of that
CBT Agent: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling like nothing is ever good enough, Harper. It sounds incredibly painful and exhausting to feel like you're chasing an impossible standard, which leads to questioning your own worth. These feelings of needing to be 'perfect' to be seen and accepted seem to weigh heavily on every aspect of your life.

When you find yourself thinking that your value depends on perfection or control, what emotions surface for you? How might these beliefs connect to the pressures you've faced regarding body image and self-worth? Recognizing and gently questioning these beliefs could be a first step towards shifting the narrative.

Letting go of the idea that changing your body will solve everything can be daunting because it's been a belief held for so long. Can you think about one small thing, perhaps a moment of self-compassion or allowing imperfection in your drawings, that might begin to open up space for self-acceptance? Exploring this together might help in redefining what being 'enough' means personally to you.
User: I think… when I feel like nothing’s ever good enough, I just feel… exhausted. I want to hide because I don’t know how to face it, but I also want to scream because I can’t escape these thoughts. It’s like everything I do is just… wrong. I don’t know how to explain it, but it feels like I’ll never be good enough for anyone—especially myself. And, yeah, I guess that connects to the whole body thing. It’s like, if my body could just look how I want it to, then maybe people would actually see me for who I am. Maybe then they’d see the real me. But I feel like that’s the only way to be worth something, and it’s so tiring to think about. I don’t know if I can ever let go of that… it’s like if I’m not trying to control everything, then who am I? But I guess, maybe… maybe if I could be okay with things not being perfect, like with my drawings or with… just me, I might not feel so… trapped? I don’t know. It’s hard to even picture that.
CBT Agent: I'm truly sorry to hear how exhausting this cycle feels for you, Harper. It sounds incredibly frustrating to feel torn between wanting to hide and wanting to be heard, especially when it comes to the struggle with feeling 'good enough.' It makes sense that you would connect this to body image, given the pressures you've faced.

When you think about shifting the need for control and perfection, what thoughts or fears come to mind? How might those fears be keeping you from seeing the real you or expressing yourself fully through your drawings or other activities? It seems like these are deep-seated beliefs about your worth tied to perfection and control, which is undoubtedly difficult. 

What might it look like to begin surprising that narrative a little bit—perhaps by accepting even a small degree of imperfection in a drawing or exploring who you are outside the need for approval or change? Starting small might make the idea of letting go feel more manageable. Over time, finding those moments where you give yourself permission to just be could help you feel a bit less trapped and more at peace with your worth, unrelated to the outcomes or external perceptions. How does the idea of exploring this step-by-step feel to you right now?
User: I’m not sure… It’s like, if I stop trying to control everything, I’ll just… fall apart. I feel like if I let go even a little, everything else will slip away too. Like I’ll lose what little control I have left, and then I won’t even be able to hold myself together. That’s my biggest fear. If I stop trying to make things perfect, I don’t know who I’ll be anymore. It’s like… I don’t even know who I am without all the rules and control I’ve put in place. But I guess, when I think about it… maybe starting small wouldn’t feel as scary? I don’t know if I could do it all at once, but maybe… if I could try to just let one thing be imperfect, even just in my drawings, maybe that would be a start? I’ve always felt like I had to do things perfectly, but I don’t know… maybe I could test it out. A little bit at a time, right? Even if it’s hard to imagine right now, maybe I could try.
CBT Agent: Your willingness to explore letting go of perfection, even just a little, is a really important step, Harper. It’s understandable to feel like control is what’s keeping everything together, and the thought of losing it could be scary. Taking small steps could be a gentle way to begin finding out who you are beyond those rules and control.

When you think about allowing imperfection into your drawings, what small change could feel safe enough to try first? How might it support you in seeing that the world won’t fall apart if things aren’t perfect? These moments could help you gradually build trust in yourself and these new explorations.

You don’t have to tackle everything at once; just letting yourself experiment with small actions can help redefine what feels 'good enough' in a way that honors your true needs and desires. What’s exciting or hopeful to you about this idea of starting small and seeing where it takes you?
User: I guess… the idea of trying something small feels a little less scary, I suppose. Maybe if I didn’t try to make every line in my drawing perfect, like… leaving some space, or not worrying about making everything match, it might be easier to let go. I think I’d still feel like I’m trying, but not as… trapped. I could try doing a few quick sketches, where I don’t care if it looks messy. Just… letting it be whatever it is without stressing over it too much. The idea of experimenting, I guess… it’s not as bad as thinking I have to have it all figured out right away. It feels like I’d have some freedom to explore, without all that pressure. Maybe that’s what I need—a way to let go without everything crashing down. It feels like it could give me space to figure out who I am beyond all the rules I’ve set for myself. That’s kind of hopeful, actually. I don’t know… maybe it’s worth trying.
CBT Agent: I'm glad to hear that the idea of experimenting with small changes feels a bit more approachable, Harper. It sounds like such a promising way to gently challenge the need for perfection and create some breathing room for yourself. Giving yourself permission to sketch without precision—to let the lines be free and imperfect—offers a space to explore without that pressure on your shoulders.

When you think about this kind of exploratory drawing, what feelings or thoughts do you anticipate coming up? How might you remind yourself that it's okay to leave things unfinished or imperfect as a step toward self-discovery? It sounds like you're opening the door to understanding more about who you are beyond those self-imposed rules, which is really courageous.

Exploring this freedom could give you more insight into yourself and maybe even a sense of lightness that’s been missing. What support or reminders might help you as you take this step into experimenting with imperfection?
User: I think… I’ll probably feel frustrated at first. Like, part of me will want to fix it, to make it ‘right,’ but another part of me will remind myself that it’s okay to just… let it go. I think I’d have to remind myself that drawing isn’t about being perfect, it’s just about expressing what’s inside, even if it doesn’t make sense or doesn’t look exactly how I want. Maybe I could say to myself, “It’s just a sketch,” or “This is for me, not for anyone else.” I guess, when the frustration or doubt comes up, I could try to focus on how it feels in that moment, instead of focusing on what the outcome looks like. Like, maybe I can find some peace in just… doing it, without judging it so much. I think that would help me let go a little. I don’t know if I’ll be able to do it right away, but even starting small might give me a chance to see that it doesn’t all have to be perfect. I think it’ll be hard, but maybe it’s a step in the right direction.
CBT Agent: It’s understandable that you might feel a mix of frustration and relief as you begin this process of letting go of perfection, Harper. You're doing something really powerful by giving yourself permission to create just for yourself, and those reminders can be incredibly grounding. “It’s just a sketch,” or “This is for me, not for anyone else,” are gentle affirmations that can help center you in the moment.

When frustration or doubt arises, bringing your focus to the act of drawing itself could help you find that peace and freedom you're seeking. As you embark on this exploration, what other affirmations or supportive thoughts might resonate with you during moments of doubt or self-criticism? How will you know when something begins to feel more freeing rather than confining?

Embracing this step-by-step approach acknowledges both your courage and the complexity of change, making room for self-discovery at your own pace. Trust your own timing and know that each small step you take is indeed a significant move in the right direction. What might you do after a drawing session to reflect on how it felt to create without judgment?
User: I think maybe I could remind myself that “It’s okay to make mistakes,” or “This doesn’t have to be perfect to be valuable.” That way, I won’t feel like I’m doing something wrong. And if I start to feel overwhelmed, maybe I can just take a deep breath and remind myself that drawing doesn’t have to be a final product. It’s okay if it’s messy or unfinished. I think I’ll know it’s starting to feel freeing when I stop worrying about what other people might think, or even what I might think. Like, if I can just enjoy the process, instead of stressing about the end result, that’ll be a sign. After I finish a drawing, I guess I could take a moment to ask myself how it felt to just let go and create, instead of judging myself for what I made. Even if it’s not exactly how I imagined, I’ll remind myself that it’s still a part of me, and that’s enough for now. I could even jot down a few words about how it felt, so I don’t forget that it was a step forward
CBT Agent: Those affirmations, “It’s okay to make mistakes," and "This doesn’t have to be perfect to be valuable," sound wonderfully nurturing, Harper. They create space for you to embrace imperfection and release self-criticism, helping you to focus more on the joy of creating. Taking a deep breath when overwhelmed is a great way to re-center yourself, affirming that the act of drawing isn't about achieving perfection but exploring freely.

When you shift from thinking about the final product to enjoying the process, that's truly transformational. What you’ve described—a moment where you feel freedom from external judgment or self-doubt—is such an insightful metric of progress. When you reflect after a drawing session, jotting down your feelings can help reinforce that positive experience and serve as a reminder of your growth.

As you continue on this path, what changes or realizations do you hope to observe within yourself? How might these small steps in your art influence other areas of life where perfectionism might have taken hold? Exploring this could deepen your understanding and affirm your journey towards self-discovery and acceptance.
User: I think one thing I’d like to notice is how I feel about myself in those moments when I’m not stressing about perfection. Maybe I’ll start to feel less anxious or less focused on needing to prove myself. I hope that by letting go of control in my drawings, I can begin to do that in other areas too—like with my body image or in how I relate to others. If I can show myself that it’s okay to be imperfect with my art, maybe I’ll be able to accept the imperfections in other parts of my life too.
CBT Agent: It sounds like you’re at the start of something truly meaningful, Harper. Recognizing those moments of freedom from perfection is a profound step towards feeling less anxious and kinder to yourself. As you practice letting go in your drawings, it might gently ripple into other parts of your life, helping you embrace imperfections with more ease. 

What comes up for you when you think about applying this mindset to your body image or relationships? How might treating yourself with the same compassion you find during your drawing sessions influence your self-view and interactions with others? As you explore this, such reflections might guide you in discovering deeper self-acceptance.

You’re showing such courage in this journey, Harper. The process of allowing imperfections to be part of your story can lead to more fulfilling connections with yourself and others. What’s one way you might remind yourself to carry this flexibility and acceptance beyond your artwork into your daily life?
User:  I think applying this to my body image is going to be really challenging, but it’s also where I want to focus the most. I’ve been so hard on myself for not meeting certain standards, so trying to look at my body with the same compassion I’m starting to give my drawings feels like a big step. I think if I can look at myself in the mirror without judgment, or even just appreciate what my body does for me rather than how it looks, that could be huge. For my relationships, I think I can use the same mindset of being kind and accepting, instead of trying to mold myself to what others want or expect. I’ve been afraid of being too much or not enough, but maybe by accepting myself more, I can accept others more too—without feeling like I need to change for them.
CBT Agent: Addressing body image and relationships with compassion is indeed a big step, Harper. Acknowledging the progress you’ve made in your drawings can be a wonderful foundation for extending that same kindness towards yourself when faced with societal and personal standards. Focusing on what your body accomplishes each day rather than solely its appearance is a powerful shift that can nurture your self-esteem and sense of self-worth.

When you stand before the mirror, what thoughts or affirmations can help ground this new compassionate view? In relationships, how do you think this self-acceptance might transform your interactions—allowing you to connect with others authentically, without feeling pressured to change?

By accepting yourself, you're opening up a space where acceptance is mutual and empowering. It’s courageous to embrace these areas in your life with such a gentle attitude. What might be a small step in cultivating this compassion daily, both for yourself and in your connections with others?
User: When I stand in front of the mirror, I think the affirmation “My body is enough just as it is” could be helpful. Also, something like “I’m grateful for all the things my body allows me to do every day” might help me appreciate it beyond just how it looks. It’s a way of shifting the focus from appearance to gratitude, which feels like a healthier perspective. In relationships, I think by being more accepting of myself, I’ll feel less like I need to fit into a mold to be liked or loved. It’ll allow me to show up as who I really am, rather than trying to be what I think others expect. That feels freeing, like it could make my connections more authentic and less tied to approval or perfection.
CBT Agent: It’s wonderful to hear that you're considering such meaningful affirmations, Harper. Reminding yourself, “My body is enough just as it is,” and focusing on gratitude can truly shift your perspective, encompassing both self-compassion and appreciation for your body’s capabilities. This approach not only nurtures a healthier body image but also aligns with valuing yourself for who you are beyond physical appearance.

In relationships, cultivating this self-acceptance can certainly transform how you connect with others. When you allow yourself to be authentic and break free from the expectations of others, it indeed opens the door to more genuine and fulfilling interactions. How might this change in perspective influence your day-to-day experiences with yourself and the people around you? 

As you continue to adopt these shifts, celebrating even small moments of connection and self-recognition can reinforce this new mindset. What's one small thing you might do today to honor this transformation within your body image or relationships, perhaps something that aligns with the freedom you’re beginning to feel?
User: Today, I think I’ll start by taking a moment to appreciate my body for what it allows me to do, like the way it carries me through the day and lets me create. I might even spend a few minutes looking in the mirror, not focusing on appearance, but just being grateful for my body as it is. In relationships, I could take a small step by letting myself be more open and authentic in a conversation, without worrying about how I’m being perceived. Maybe just sharing a little more about what’s on my mind or expressing something I’ve been holding back could help me show up more genuinely. Both of these feel like ways to honor the freedom I’m starting to embrace in my art and in how I treat myself.
CBT Agent: Those sound like truly empowering steps, Harper. Taking a moment to appreciate your body for its capabilities is a meaningful practice in cultivating gratitude and self-compassion. Allowing yourself to stand in front of the mirror with a focus on what your body enables you to do, rather than just its appearance, seems like a beautiful way to reinforce this appreciation. 

In conversations, being open and authentic is another significant way to build genuine connections. By sharing what's truly on your mind, you create opportunities for deeper understanding and trust in your relationships, which is aligned with the growing sense of freedom you're embracing.

As you practice these changes today, what might you notice about your feelings or thoughts that indicates this approach is supporting your journey towards self-acceptance and openness? How could these experiences today encourage you to continue fostering this new mindset going forward?

These actions you're taking today serve as important reflections of the growth and resilience you're demonstrating. If there's any part of this you'd like to explore further or anything you feel uncertain about, let's touch on it, so you feel supported in each step.
User: I think today, I’ll pay close attention to how I feel before and after these moments—especially during that time in front of the mirror or when I’m being open with someone. It’s easy for me to fall into old habits, so I want to catch any shifts in how I view myself or my relationships in those moments. If I start to feel more ease or even just a little bit of pride, I’ll hold onto that and remind myself that this is the start of something new. If I notice any discomfort or doubt, I’ll try not to judge it, but instead think about it as part of the process—learning to move through it and not letting it define me. What I hope to see is that these actions—small as they are—can actually have a big impact on my mindset and how I connect with myself and others. I want to keep reminding myself that I’m worthy of these changes, even if they feel challenging at first.
CBT Agent: Your approach is so thoughtful, Harper. By tuning into your feelings and thoughts before and after these experiences, you're creating a self-awareness that supports meaningful change. Acknowledging any ease or pride that emerges is a wonderful way to reinforce that sense of new beginnings, and viewing discomfort as simply part of the journey allows for growth without self-judgment.

What you’re doing might feel challenging at first, but the intention and actions you’re setting here carry significant potential for transformation in how you see yourself and relate to others. Each small step is a testament to your worthiness of change and acceptance. How might you celebrate these moments of ease or self-expression as you recognize them throughout your day? 

Perhaps there’s a way to treat yourself kindly in those moments, affirming the positive shifts you’re embarking on. Remember, you're not alone in this process, and every step you take is further solidifying a caring and compassionate relationship with yourself. Is there anything specific you'd like to focus on or return to next time that felt particularly hopeful in our conversation today?
