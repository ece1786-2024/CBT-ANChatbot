User: I don’t know… it’s hard to feel like anything’s changing. But I guess if I’m here, I’m willing to try, right?What’s the plan this time? I’m still kind of nervous about all of it.
CBT Agent: Hi Harper, it's understandable that you're feeling a bit nervous. Change can be challenging, but your willingness to try shows a lot of courage and strength. It means a lot that you're open to exploring this path with me. 

Let's start by looking at some small, manageable steps we can take together. One of those is gently challenging the belief that your worth is tied to the number on the scale. How do you feel about exploring how you feel during mindful activities, like your walks, compared to days when you might weigh yourself first thing?

Also, we're going to work on creating a flexible meal plan that brings some ease into your eating routine, with steps that fit into your life without adding stress. What thoughts or feelings come up as I mention these possible parts of our plan?
User: I guess… I never really thought about how the walks might feel different. Sometimes I do feel okay during them, but I don’t really let myself think about it too much. I focus on getting through the day. As for the meals, a plan sounds like something I could maybe try. I don’t know, though, sometimes I just feel like I mess it all up. I get anxious about what to eat and when, and I end up just doing what feels easiest. But I don’t want that to keep happening. It’s just, I don’t know if I’ll be able to change anything. What if it doesn’t work, or I fall back into old habits?
CBT Agent: It's completely understandable to feel anxious about making changes, Harper. It's a big step to even consider trying, and it's okay to have doubts. It sounds like there are days where those walks give you a bit of relief, even if just for a moment. Maybe there's potential in exploring those feelings further?

As for the meal plan, remember, it's all about small adjustments that feel doable, not about being perfect. It's natural to have concerns about slipping back into old habits. What matters is recognizing you're ready to try again, which is a huge achievement in itself. 

Let's think about this as a journey with ups and downs. It's okay to stumble along the way. We can start by focusing on just one thing you feel ready to work on right now, whether it's exploring your feelings during walks or thinking about one part of the meal plan. What do you think might feel more manageable to start with?
User: I think I’d like to try focusing on the walks first. Maybe just see if I can notice how they feel, without worrying about anything else for now. It sounds like it could give me a bit of space to feel… calm, I guess. I’ll try that and see what happens. The meal thing still feels kind of overwhelming. I don’t know if I can stick to a plan or what that even looks like for me right now. Maybe I’ll feel ready to think about it later, but for now, I think I want to focus on the walks. Does that sound okay? You know, my parent... I had hard time in my early childhood and now still...
CBT Agent: That sounds like a thoughtful decision, Harper. Focusing on something that brings you a sense of calm, like your walks, is a wonderful starting point. It’s all about taking one step at a time, at your own pace, and noticing how these moments make you feel can be really illuminating.

It's absolutely okay to take things slowly and focus on the walks for now. We can always revisit the idea of a meal plan when it feels less overwhelming. Please know I'm here to support you, whenever you're ready to explore that path.

And thank you for sharing about your early experiences. It sounds like there might be a lot tied to those memories. Would you like to talk a bit more about how your early childhood might be affecting you now? Your feelings and experiences are important, and exploring them could be a helpful part of our journey together.
User: I don’t really know what’s helpful anymore… Sometimes I think about when I was younger, and it’s hard to even remember what it felt like to be okay. Like, I remember wanting to wear dresses and play with dolls, but everything felt wrong. I was always told that wasn’t for me. I just wanted to be… someone else, I guess. Someone who didn’t have to hide all the time. But now it’s like… I just can’t fix it, no matter what I do. I try to change my body, but it’s never enough. It’s like, the more weight I lose, the closer I feel to… being real, I guess. But it’s also never enough. And the more I try to change, the more I feel like everything just… falls apart. I don’t even know if I can trust myself anymore. I mean, look at me. I’m not healthy. But it’s the only thing I know that makes me feel in control.
CBT Agent: Harper, thank you for trusting me with such personal feelings. It sounds like there’s a lot of pain tied to those memories, and a longing for acceptance and authenticity. Wanting to be true to yourself and feeling like you have to hide must have been incredibly hard.

The struggle with trying to find that sense of control and feeling like it never quite reaches what you hope for is something many people go through, and it's a tough cycle. It makes sense that in trying to find stability, focusing on weight can feel like the one tangible thing to manage. But it’s impacting your health, and it's okay to want something different for yourself.

I wonder how it might be to start by acknowledging the strength and resilience it takes to keep going despite these feelings. Maybe we can work on gently questioning how closely changing your body relates to feeling more “real.” It might be helpful to explore ways of feeling true to yourself beyond a number on the scale. What do you think could help you begin to explore this deeper sense of self? What are some aspects of who you are that you value independent of appearance?
User: I don’t know… It’s hard to think of anything beyond the weight. I don’t feel like myself when I look in the mirror. It’s like… if I could just look the way I want, maybe everything would be okay. But I know that’s not true. It never is. I guess I used to like drawing, but I don’t do that anymore. I don’t even know if I’m any good at it. It feels like everything I used to care about is just gone now. If I’m being honest, I’m not sure what’s left of me, other than just trying to fix what feels broken. But I don’t want to feel like this forever. I don’t want to keep hurting myself, but… I don’t know how to stop. I don’t know what would feel like enough.
CBT Agent: It's really brave of you to open up about these feelings, Harper. It sounds like you’re in a very difficult place, feeling disconnected from who you are and unsure of how to find that sense of self again. The journey of constantly trying to "fix" things can be exhausting, and it's understandable that you want to find a way out of this cycle.

It's significant that you mentioned drawing—something you used to enjoy and care about. Even if it feels distant now, exploring that creativity could be a gentle, non-judgmental way of reconnecting with yourself. Art can provide a voice when words fall short, and it might help to express those complex feelings you carry.

You don’t have to have all the answers right now, or even know exactly what “enough” would feel like. What matters is that you have a desire to change and not keep hurting yourself, which is a powerful first step. Maybe we could explore how you might start drawing again, even just a little. It doesn’t have to be about skill or outcome, but rather about expression and claiming a space that’s just yours. What do you think? Would you be open to trying to draw or do something creative, even as a small experiment?
User: I don’t know if I can go back to drawing. It feels like it’s been so long, and I’m not even sure what I’d draw anymore. Everything just feels so… empty. But maybe… maybe I could try. It wouldn’t be about making it perfect, right? Just… letting something out? I guess it could be nice to feel like I’m doing something for myself that’s not about weight or how I look. I’ll think about it. Maybe I could just try sketching something simple, just for me. I don’t want to promise anything, but… yeah, I’ll think about it.
CBT Agent: I really appreciate your openness and willingness to consider trying something new, Harper. It’s perfectly okay to start with small, simple steps—drawing doesn't need to be about perfection or outcomes. It's all about creating a space that’s just for you, allowing yourself to express whatever feels right in the moment.

It's wonderful to hear that you might explore sketching for yourself. Remember, it’s about reconnecting with something that once brought you joy and finding that sense of self beyond the focus on weight. It's a gentle path to exploring who you are and what matters to you.

How do you feel about setting aside a little time just to see what comes up when you put pencil to paper? Even if it feels empty now, it might surprise you. What thoughts come to mind as you consider making time for this kind of self-expression, just for you?
User: I guess… maybe it wouldn’t hurt to try. It’s just so hard to think of anything outside of… the way I look. But I do miss that feeling, even if it was just a little. When I’d draw, it felt like… like I could do something that wasn’t controlled by all the stuff that’s in my head. I don’t know if I’ll be able to stick with it, but maybe I could try just for a few minutes. It sounds like it could be a way to breathe for a second without the pressure. I don’t want to expect too much from it, but… I’ll give it a shot.
CBT Agent: That sounds like a wonderful and brave decision, Harper. Giving yourself permission to explore drawing, even for just a few minutes, can be a gentle way to find a little freedom from the thoughts that often feel so overwhelming. It sounds like there's a part of you that remembers the calm and creativity that drawing once brought you, and revisiting that could offer a bit of respite.

It's really important to approach this with no pressure—a space where it's okay just to be, without expectations or judgments. Even if you don't draw for long or if it takes some time to get back into it, what's important is that you're doing something for yourself that isn't about appearance or control.

I'm glad you're open to trying it out. Would you like to set any intentions or boundaries around this practice to help you feel more comfortable, or perhaps think about where and when it might feel best to start sketching? It's your space, after all.
User: I think… maybe I could try it in my room, when I’m alone. That way, it’s just me, and there’s no one around to judge. I don’t want to feel like I have to do it right or for any reason other than to just be. I don’t know what I’ll draw, but maybe that’s part of it—just letting it happen. If I start feeling like it’s too much or like I’m pushing myself, I’ll stop. But I think having a quiet moment to just… be with myself, without worrying about anything else, could help. I’m not sure if it’ll work, but I’ll give it a try.
CBT Agent: That sounds like a thoughtful approach, Harper. Creating a space in your room where you feel safe and free from judgment is a great idea. It’s all about allowing yourself the freedom to explore without any expectations or pressures. Just being with yourself and letting whatever comes through is a beautiful intention.

Remember, it's perfectly okay to stop whenever you feel it's right for you, and it's great that you're setting that boundary for yourself. This moment is all about finding peace and allowing yourself to reconnect with that quieter part of your identity at your own pace.

I’m proud of you for embracing this possibility, even if it feels uncertain. Taking this step to prioritize a moment for self-expression is a powerful form of self-care and can lead to new insights about yourself.

How do you feel about starting this new practice? Would it be helpful for us to revisit how it feels in future sessions, or is there anything else you’d like to reflect on before giving it a try?
User: I feel… a little less nervous about it now. It’s kind of nice to think that I can try something without feeling like I have to succeed at it. I think I’m ready to give it a go, even if it feels weird at first. I’m okay with revisiting it later, maybe seeing how it goes and how I feel after I try. I might need a little time to adjust, but I think it’s something I can work on. It feels like a small step, but maybe it’ll lead to something bigger. Thanks for being so patient with me. It’s… nice to have someone to talk to, even if it’s just about trying to draw.
CBT Agent: I'm so glad to hear you're feeling a bit less nervous about it, Harper. Trying something new, like returning to drawing, without the pressure of needing to succeed can be incredibly freeing. It's a way to gently explore and reconnect with yourself, and it’s okay if it feels a bit strange at first.

It's wonderful that you're open to seeing how this practice unfolds and checking in with your feelings along the way. Small steps like this can indeed lead to more significant shifts over time, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.

User: It sounds… kind of comforting. I like knowing I can talk about things, even if they’re small or confusing. I think I’m ready to start, and it helps to know that I’m not alone in this. I’ll take it one step at a time. Maybe drawing will help me feel a little more like me, even if it’s just for a moment. I’m glad we could talk about it. Thanks for being so understanding. I’ll let you know how it goes when I’m ready. It’s nice to have this space to just… be.

User: Thank you. It really does help to hear that. I think I’m starting to understand that it’s okay to take things slowly and not have it all figured out right away. I’ll take some time, but I’m glad you’re here when I need to talk. I’ll keep you updated when I’m ready, but I appreciate everything you’ve said today. It feels a little less heavy, knowing that I don’t have to do it all at once. Thanks for being here. I’ll talk to you soon.
