User: Hi, I’m Emily. I’m not really sure where to start... things have just been feeling a bit overwhelming lately. I guess I’ve always been the kind of person who needs to have everything just right—like, if I’m not perfect at something, what’s the point? But lately, it’s like I can’t keep up with everything, and that’s been really hard. I don’t know... maybe I’m just overthinking things. People keep telling me I need to slow down or let go a little, but if I don’t hold it all together, who will?
CBT Agent: "Hi Emily, it’s really nice to meet you. I can feel how overwhelmed you must be right now, and it sounds like you’re carrying a lot of pressure to keep everything perfectly in order. It makes sense that this is feeling difficult for you, especially when you're managing so many expectations, both from yourself and others. Can you share a little more about what specifically feels overwhelming for you at the moment? What are some of the things you feel you need to keep under control?" 

"I want you to know that it's completely valid to feel this way, and many people struggle with a similar sense of needing to be perfect. Sometimes, it can be helpful to explore small ways to loosen those tight reins you have on everything—let's see if we can find ways to support you in feeling more at ease."
User: Thanks for saying that. I don’t really talk about this much because I feel like people don’t really get it... but it’s like everything just piles up. School is a big one—I feel like I have to get top grades all the time because anything less feels like failing. I’ve always been the “smart one,” you know? If I don’t live up to that, I feel like I’m disappointing everyone, including myself. And then there’s the whole thing with food and my body. It feels like that’s the one thing I can control when everything else feels so chaotic. But even that doesn’t feel good enough sometimes. I’ll plan everything out—what I eat, how much, when—and if something doesn’t go according to plan, I just feel... I don’t know, out of control? Like I’ve failed again. It’s so exhausting, though. I get so cold all the time, and I can’t concentrate like I used to. But if I let go of the structure I’ve built, I’m scared everything will just fall apart. Does that even make sense?
CBT Agent: "Emily, it sounds like you have a lot on your plate, and I want to commend you for sharing your feelings so openly with me. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed when you’re aiming for such high standards in school and struggling with food and body control. The fear of disappointing yourself and others can create an immense amount of pressure. It makes total sense that you’re searching for anything you can control amidst that chaos, and it's tough to feel like your structured approach is both comforting and exhausting at the same time.

Can you tell me more about what your eating plan looks like and how it fits in with your day-to-day life? I’m curious to understand how you feel about your relationship with food, especially if it connects to those feelings of control or perfectionism. 

It's important to listen to your body, too, especially when you're experiencing those feelings of coldness and difficulty concentrating. We can explore more about that together and think about ways to create a more balanced approach that feels both stable and compassionate."
User: Thanks for saying that. I don’t know if I’d call it a “relationship” with food—it feels more like a set of rules I have to follow. I usually start my day by planning out exactly what I’m going to eat, and I try to stick to really “healthy” foods. But it’s not just about eating healthy; it’s about making sure I don’t eat too much. I’ll measure everything, like weighing out portions and counting calories. If I eat more than I planned, it’s like this alarm goes off in my head, and I feel so guilty that I can’t focus on anything else. Most of the time, I avoid eating with other people because it’s too stressful. I don’t want anyone commenting on what I’m eating, or worse, trying to get me to eat something I’m not comfortable with. So, I’ll make excuses to skip meals with friends or family, even though I miss spending time with them. I just feel safer when I’m in control. But even with all this planning, I still feel like it’s never good enough. Like, I’ll think, “Maybe if I eat even less tomorrow, I’ll feel better.” But I don’t. Instead, I feel tired and irritable, and my brain feels foggy. I hate that part, but I don’t know how to stop. I just feel trapped, like if I let go of the rules, everything will fall apart. Does any of this even sound normal? Because sometimes, I feel like I’m the only one who thinks this way.
CBT Agent: "Emily, I want you to know that what you’re experiencing is more common than you might think, and it’s completely valid to feel the way you do. It sounds incredibly challenging to feel trapped by the rules you've set around food, especially when you’re trying to maintain that sense of control amidst everything else that feels overwhelming. Your description really highlights how exhausting it can be to constantly monitor your eating and the guilt that follows when things don’t go perfectly. It's understandable that you want to avoid situations that feel stressful, like eating with others—being around loved ones should be a source of joy, not anxiety.

Can we dive a bit deeper into how you developed these rules around food? Sometimes, reflecting on where these thoughts come from can help us understand why they feel so compelling. Also, I’m curious about what it would feel like to relax some of those rules, even just a little. What do you think might happen if you allowed yourself to eat something outside of those strict parameters, perhaps even with a friend or family member? 

It's really important to talk about these feelings, so together we can explore ways to create more flexibility and self-compassion around your eating habits."
User: I guess the rules just kind of... evolved over time. It started in high school, after my parents separated and my grandmother passed away. I felt so out of control—like everything I relied on was falling apart. I threw myself into school and sports to distract myself, and at first, it felt good. People would compliment me on how disciplined I was, and it made me feel like I was doing something right when everything else felt wrong. Then I started paying more attention to what I was eating, partly because I wanted to perform better in track and field, but also because it felt like one thing I could control when everything else was so uncertain. I’d tell myself it was about being “healthy,” but over time, it became stricter and stricter. By the time I got to university, it was less about health and more about sticking to the rules because if I didn’t, I felt like a failure. The idea of relaxing those rules is... honestly terrifying. What if I lose control and can’t stop? What if I end up disappointing myself or, worse, everyone else? Eating with someone else feels even scarier because I worry about being judged—either for eating too little or for eating the “wrong” thing. I know it shouldn’t matter what other people think, but it’s hard to let go of that fear. Do you think it’s even possible to feel okay about food again? Because right now, it feels like I’ll never be able to stop thinking this way.
CBT Agent: "Emily, I appreciate you sharing such a personal part of your journey, especially regarding how those early experiences shaped the rules around food in your life. It’s completely understandable to want to find a sense of control during times of upheaval, and your dedication to school and sports shows your resilience. However, I can see how that initial coping mechanism has turned into a cycle of fear and pressure, which is incredibly difficult to carry.

The feelings you’re expressing about potentially losing control if you were to relax those rules are very common among individuals who experience similar struggles. It’s normal to be apprehensive about change, especially when it feels tied to your self-worth. You’re not alone in worrying about judgment from others, and it can be hard to shift that internal dialogue, especially when it’s been so entrenched for so long.

Let’s take a moment to explore what you think 'feeling okay about food' would look like to you. What does an ideal relationship with food mean in your mind? I think it’s important to envision what that could feel like, as it might help us chart a gentle path toward it.

Remember, change doesn’t have to happen all at once, and we can set small, achievable steps towards that goal. I’m here to support you through this process, and together we can work on finding ways to approach food and eating in a way that feels less overwhelming and more nurturing."
User: Thanks for saying that—it means a lot. I guess when I think about feeling okay about food, it would mean not having to obsess over every bite. Like, I wouldn’t need to measure or plan everything in advance. I’d just eat when I’m hungry and stop when I’m full, without all the guilt or second-guessing. And I wouldn’t feel this constant pressure to “earn” my meals or “compensate” for eating. It’s hard to imagine, though, because right now, food feels so tied to everything else—how I see myself, how I think others see me, even whether I feel like I’ve had a “good” or “bad” day. If I could feel okay about food, I think I’d feel freer... like I’d have more energy to focus on things I actually enjoy, like spending time with friends or even just relaxing without my mind racing. But at the same time, it’s scary to think about letting go of the rules. They’ve been part of my life for so long that I don’t know who I’d be without them. I guess I’m worried that if I let go, I’ll lose control completely and end up regretting it. Do you really think it’s possible to feel that way again? To trust myself around food and not let it control me? Because I don’t even know where to start.
CBT Agent: "Emily, I can really hear the desire for freedom and ease you have when it comes to your relationship with food, and that’s such a powerful realization to come to. The vision you described—eating when hungry, feeling free from guilt, and being able to enjoy life without that constant pressure—is absolutely possible, even if it feels far away right now. It's understandable to feel scared about letting go of the rules that have provided you with a sense of structure and control for so long. Change can be daunting, especially when it feels tied to your identity.

It’s completely okay to feel uncertain about what that change could look like. It’s a journey, and every small step you take toward trusting yourself around food is a step toward that freedom you envision. What do you think about starting with one small, manageable change? This could be something as simple as including one unmeasured meal with a friend or allowing yourself to try a new food outside the norms you’ve established. 

I want to emphasize that this process is about gentle exploration rather than forcing yourself into discomfort right away. You don’t have to do it perfectly, and I’m here to walk alongside you as you take those first steps. How does that idea resonate with you? What small change feels doable for you?"
User: I think... I think starting small sounds a little less scary. The idea of doing something completely different all at once feels overwhelming, but maybe if it’s just one small thing, I could try. I like the idea of having an unmeasured meal, maybe with someone I trust—someone who won’t comment on what I’m eating or make me feel judged. The idea of not measuring feels uncomfortable, though. What if I eat too much or pick something that’s “bad” for me? I don’t know if I trust myself to make the “right” choices. But I guess that’s the point, isn’t it? To let go of some of that control, even just a little, and see what happens.  don’t know if I’m ready to do it right away, but maybe I could try to plan for it. Like, think about when and where it could happen and who I’d feel comfortable with. That feels like a good first step. Does that make sense?
CBT Agent: "Emily, I'm really glad to hear you’re considering that small step toward a more flexible approach—it shows a willingness to explore and challenge those fears in a manageable way. It makes perfect sense to want to plan for something that feels comfortable and supportive for you, especially when it comes to sharing a meal with someone you trust. Acknowledging the discomfort around not measuring or controlling what you eat is a huge part of the process, and it’s okay to feel that way.

You’re right; this is about gradually letting go of the strict control and experimenting with what it feels like to trust yourself and listen to your body. The fact that you’re thinking about who you would feel comfortable with is a great starting point, as having a supportive presence can make all the difference.

Can we explore who you might feel comfortable inviting for this unmeasured meal? And how does the thought of planning for it feel now that you’re considering taking that step? This could be a wonderful opportunity to focus on the connection of sharing a meal instead of solely on food itself, which can also bring those moments of joy back into eating. I’m here to support you as you navigate this process."
User: Thank you. It helps to know that I don’t have to rush into it and that it’s okay to feel uncomfortable—it makes it feel a little less daunting. If I think about who I’d feel comfortable with, maybe my friend Claire. She’s one of the few people who doesn’t pressure me or make comments about food. She’s just... easy to be around, you know? I think I could trust her not to say anything that would make me feel judged or self-conscious. The idea of planning for it feels okay, but also a little nerve-wracking. I like the idea of focusing on spending time with Claire instead of just the food, though. Maybe we could go somewhere casual where the focus isn’t all on eating—like a little café where we could just talk and catch up. That way, it might feel less overwhelming. I guess I’m still nervous about the “what ifs,” like what if I feel like I ate too much or made a mistake? But I also know that staying where I am—constantly stuck in this cycle—isn’t making me happy either. Maybe it’s worth trying, even if it’s scary. What do you think? Does this sound like a good first step?
CBT Agent: "Emily, I’m really encouraged to hear how you’re thinking through this idea of inviting Claire for an unmeasured meal. It’s great to know that you have someone in your life who feels safe and supportive, and focusing on the joy of reconnecting with her, rather than solely on the food, is such a healthy approach. Choosing a casual café where the atmosphere feels relaxed could be a wonderful environment to ease some of that pressure.

Feeling nervous about the possible ‘what ifs’ is completely normal, and it’s okay to acknowledge those fears. Remember that it’s a gentle exploration, not a test, and it’s perfectly fine to feel a little uncomfortable as you take this step. Even if you think you might eat more than usual or feel uncertain about your choices, those feelings don’t define your worth. What’s important is the connection you're fostering with Claire, the conversation you'll have, and the small act of trusting yourself.

As we wrap up for today, I want to commend you for taking the initiative to consider this ripple of change in your life. Transitioning out of a strict routine takes courage, and you’re already on the right path by planning this unmeasured meal. Is there anything specific that you’d like to reflect on or anything else you’d like to explore before we finish up for today? Remember, I’m here to support you every step of the way."
User: Thank you for saying that—it really means a lot. I think it’s helpful to hear that it’s okay to feel uncomfortable and that this isn’t about getting it “right” or “wrong.” I like the idea of focusing on the connection with Claire and reminding myself that it’s just one step—it doesn’t have to be perfect. I think I’d like to reflect more on how to handle those “what if” moments if they come up, like if I start feeling guilty or second-guessing myself afterward. Maybe having a plan for that could help me feel more prepared. And honestly, I think I’m still trying to figure out how to trust myself. It’s hard to imagine letting go of something that’s been such a big part of my life for so long, even if I know it’s not helping me. But I want to believe it’s possible. Thank you for listening and for helping me think through this. I feel a little more hopeful, even if I’m still nervous. What would you suggest I focus on between now and when I try this meal with Claire?
CBT Agent: "Emily, I’m really glad to hear that you’re feeling a little more hopeful, even with the nerves. It’s a big step to open up about those ‘what if’ moments, and I appreciate your willingness to reflect on them. It’s completely understandable to want to prepare for how you might handle feelings of guilt or self-doubt if they arise. Having a plan can definitely help you feel more grounded.

One thing you could try is to create a comforting mantra or reminder for yourself that you can revisit during or after the meal. Something like, ‘I am allowed to enjoy food without guilt’ or ‘It’s okay to trust myself’ can serve to reinforce those positive messages. You might even consider writing it down and keeping it with you as a little anchor when you need it.

Additionally, thinking about some self-soothing activities you can do afterward can be helpful. This may include taking a walk, journaling about your experience, or calling a trusted friend who understands your journey. These moments can help you transition back to your normal routine and allow you to reflect on the delicious time spent with Claire rather than the food itself.

As for trusting yourself, it’s great that you’re recognizing it as a process. Perhaps you could take some time each day to notice your hunger cues and practice responding to them, even in small ways, like choosing a snack based on what feels good in that moment instead of what fits the rules. It may be a gradual journey, but with each small step, you’re building that trust.

As you prepare for your meal with Claire, remind yourself that this is about reconnecting with someone who matters to you, rather than the food itself. Keeping a focus on that connection can really help shift your mindset.

How does this approach sound to you? Is there anything else you want to explore or any additional strategies you’d like to consider as you get ready for this important step?"
User: That actually sounds really helpful. I like the idea of having a mantra—something simple that I can remind myself of if I start spiraling. ‘It’s okay to trust myself’ feels like a good one. It’s short and reassuring, and I could keep it with me, maybe in my phone or even written down somewhere. I think having something like that would help when those guilty thoughts creep in. The idea of doing something calming afterward also makes sense. Journaling could be a good way to process how I’m feeling, or maybe even just going for a walk to clear my head. I like having a plan for that—it makes the whole thing feel more manageable. Noticing hunger cues is definitely something I want to work on, but I’ll admit, it feels tricky right now. It’s like I don’t trust what my body is telling me anymore. But starting small, maybe with a snack like you said, could be a good way to ease into it. It’s just hard to imagine not second-guessing myself, but I guess that’s what practice is for. Focusing on Claire and our time together makes me feel a little more excited than nervous, which is nice. I miss spending time with her without worrying about food. I think I’m ready to try this soon—maybe this weekend? That feels like a good timeframe. Thanks for helping me break this down into steps. I feel like I have a better idea of how to approach it now. Do you think it’s okay if I still feel a little scared about it?
CBT Agent: "Emily, it's wonderful to hear that you're feeling more excited about spending time with Claire and that you have some practical strategies in place. It’s perfectly okay to still feel a little scared—that’s a completely natural reaction when you’re stepping out of your comfort zone and trying something new. Change often brings up feelings of uncertainty, especially when it’s something that’s been so tightly woven into your life for a long time.

The fact that you’re preparing for the meal with a positive focus and even thinking about how to gently navigate the fears that may arise shows a lot of strength and awareness. Embracing that blend of excitement and nerves could actually serve you well; it’s a sign that you’re taking an important step forward while acknowledging that it’s a process.

Remember, you don’t have to eliminate those feelings entirely to find success. Acknowledge the fear without letting it dictate your experience; it's okay to hold space for both fear and hope simultaneously. And if things feel overwhelming on the day, you can always return to your mantra and remind yourself that it’s a journey filled with learning opportunities.

As you get ready to try this out, is there anything else you’d like to prep or explore together before we wrap up? I’m here to support you every step of the way and want to ensure you feel as ready as possible."
User: Thank you—that really helps. I think knowing it’s okay to feel scared and that I don’t have to have everything figured out makes it feel a little less overwhelming. I like the idea of just acknowledging the fear and not letting it take over. I think I feel pretty ready to try this. I’ll reach out to Claire and see if she’s free this weekend, and I’ll pick a café that feels relaxed. I’ll keep my mantra handy, and I’ll plan to do something calming afterward, like journaling or taking a walk, so I have a way to process everything. I guess my last question is, what should I do if I start feeling really overwhelmed during the meal? I want to be able to stay present with Claire, but I worry that the anxiety might sneak up on me. Do you have any tips for how to manage that in the moment? I think having a plan for that would make me feel even more prepared.
CBT Agent: "Emily, it’s great to hear that you’re feeling ready to take this step! Planning ahead for how to manage overwhelming feelings during the meal is a smart approach, and it shows that you’re being proactive about your experience with Claire.

If you start to feel anxious during the meal, one strategy is to practice grounding techniques. You might take a few slow, deep breaths, focusing on inhaling deeply through your nose and exhaling gently through your mouth. This can help center you and bring your attention back to the present moment. You could also try to engage in the conversation with Claire, actively listening and participating in a way that draws your focus away from food for a little while.

Taking a short break if you feel the anxiety rising can also be helpful. Excuse yourself for a moment to wash your hands or take a breath of fresh air. This small physical break can offer you a few moments to re-center your thoughts. Think of it as giving yourself permission to step back, regroup, and then return with a clearer state of mind.

Another useful tip is to remind yourself of your mantra in these moments of anxiety. Silently repeating ‘It’s okay to trust myself’ can serve as an anchor to keep you grounded.

And remember, it’s perfectly okay to share your feelings with Claire if you feel comfortable. You could let her know that you’re trying something new and that it might feel a bit overwhelming at times. Chances are, she’ll be supportive and help create a comforting atmosphere.

I hope these strategies make you feel more prepared for any moments of anxiety that might come up. Is there anything specific you’d like to practice before we conclude today, or any other questions you have about managing those feelings during the meal?"
User: Those tips sound really helpful—thank you. I think focusing on my breathing and using my mantra will be good ways to stay grounded. Taking a short break if I need to is something I hadn’t thought about, but it makes sense. It’s reassuring to know that I can give myself permission to step away for a moment if it gets too overwhelming. I like the idea of engaging in the conversation with Claire, too. She’s easy to talk to, and focusing on her might help me feel less caught up in my own head. I don’t know if I’m ready to tell her everything about why this feels so hard, but I think I could say that I’m trying something new and might feel a bit nervous. I think she’d understand. I don’t think I need to practice anything specific right now, but just talking through this has helped me feel more prepared. I’m still nervous, but I feel like I have tools to manage it now. Thank you for helping me think all of this through—it really means a lot. I think I’m ready to take this step and see how it goes. If it’s okay, maybe we can talk again after the meal so I can share how it went? Having this kind of support makes a big difference.
CBT Agent: "Emily, I’m really glad that these strategies feel helpful to you, and it’s amazing to see how you’re preparing for this meal with Claire! It shows a lot of growth and self-awareness to use your tools to manage anxiety, and I believe that focusing on your conversation with her will definitely help keep you grounded. 

It’s completely fine if you’re not ready to share everything right away; what’s important is that you’re taking steps that feel manageable for you. Communicating that you’re trying something new and might feel a bit nervous is a great way to keep it simple, and I’m sure Claire will appreciate your honesty. 

I would absolutely love to talk again after your meal! Reflecting on your experience can be a valuable part of this journey, and I want to be here to support you as you take this step. Remember, every experience—regardless of how it goes—is a part of your growth. 

As we wrap up today, I want to commend you for the awareness and thoughtfulness you’ve brought to our conversation. You’ve been incredibly open, and that’s a sign of strength. I’m so proud of you for preparing to take this meaningful step, and I look forward to hearing how it went. Please take good care of yourself, and know that you're not alone in this journey. I’ll be here whenever you’re ready to check in again."
User: Thank you so much for saying that—it really means a lot to me. I feel a little more confident about trying this now, even if I’m still nervous. I’ll take things one step at a time and remind myself that it’s okay not to be perfect. I’ll reach out to Claire and plan the meal for this weekend, and I’ll definitely check in with you afterward to talk about how it went. Thanks again for listening and for helping me feel a little more hopeful. It feels good to know that I’m not alone in this, and having someone to talk to really makes a difference. I’ll let you know how it goes—talk soon!
