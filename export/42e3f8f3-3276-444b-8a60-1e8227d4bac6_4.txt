User: sighs I don’t know… I’ve tried to draw a little, but it’s hard to focus. My mind keeps drifting to how I look, what I’ve eaten, and how much I weigh. It’s like everything else gets pushed aside. And as for my family… things haven’t really changed. My dad still won’t use my name, and my mom just… doesn’t say much. I don’t even know what to say anymore. It feels like no one really gets it. pauses I guess I’m just really stuck.
CBT Agent: Hi Harper. I can hear how heavy things feel for you right now, and it’s understandable to feel stuck when so much is happening in your mind. It sounds really challenging to redirect your focus when thoughts about appearance and food take over, especially when you're trying to engage in something as personal as drawing. Can you tell me more about what it’s like during those moments when your mind starts to drift? What thoughts or feelings are most persistent for you?

It's clear that family dynamics add another layer to what you're dealing with. Your desire for your parents to acknowledge and understand you as you are is really important, and not having that can feel really isolating. How are you managing conversations with your family currently, and what do you hope for moving forward?

As we explore these layers, remember that your interest in drawing and walking are significant parts of this journey toward expressing yourself and finding what truly matters beyond appearance. Engaging with activities that allow you to step away from those intrusive thoughts, even if just for a moment, might offer some relief. It’s okay that this process feels difficult. Let’s continue to find ways to support you in moments when it feels hard to focus, recognizing the effort you’re putting into creating that space for self-discovery. 
User: It’s like… when I try to draw or think about something else, I just can’t. My brain keeps telling me that I’m not good enough, or that if I draw, I’m just wasting time because I’m not losing weight. Like, what’s the point? And when I start thinking about my body, it’s like everything else disappears. I just fixate on the number on the scale, or on how my shoulders are too broad, or my face doesn’t look right. Sometimes I just feel like I’m not even me anymore—just this body I can’t control. Talking to my family is… exhausting. My dad just ignores anything about me being a girl, and my mom… I don’t know. She doesn’t really say anything. I don’t even know if she’s trying to understand, or if she just doesn’t care. I wish they’d at least try, but I guess I don’t really know what I want them to do either. I don’t want to be a burden, but at the same time, it’s hard to feel like I matter when they act like everything’s fine. I think I just want them to see me.
CBT Agent: Thank you for sharing what's on your mind, Harper. It truly sounds like you’re experiencing a lot of turmoil that's hard to break away from, especially when those critical thoughts about your body come in strong. Feeling as if you're not good enough is understandably distressing and can make meaningful activities feel less rewarding. I hear how crucial it is for you to feel seen and understood, especially when it comes from your family. It's really painful when you feel invisible or dismissed by those who matter to you.

Navigating these moments with your family certainly sounds exhausting. It’s only natural that you crave acknowledgment of who you are right now. Let’s explore what feeling seen and valued might look like for you. How do you envision your family’s support or understanding, and is there anything specific you wish you could communicate to them?

Drawing, despite being challenging at times, has the potential to be a space where you can express parts of yourself beyond those persistent thoughts. Might it be helpful to try connecting with drawing in a way that doesn't focus on the final result, but rather the sensations or feelings that arise during the process? This is not easy work, and each step you take toward using creative outlets is a signal of your strength in exploring who you are beyond what you see in the mirror. What might help you initiate or return to those moments when drawing feels like a way to explore rather than a task to complete?
User: I don’t know… I think if my family actually listened to me, like really listened, it would be different. Not just telling me I’m fine or it’ll get better, but really asking how I’m feeling, without trying to fix it or ignore it. I don’t even know what I’d say if they did that. I guess I just want to feel like I matter, like I’m not just a problem they have to deal with. As for drawing… I don’t really know how to make it not about the result. It’s hard, you know? When everything feels like it has to be perfect, even something like drawing can feel like a failure if it doesn’t look the way I want. But maybe if I just let go of trying to make it perfect, it wouldn’t be so bad. I don’t know how to make myself stop caring about that, though. Maybe I could try, but it feels like I’m fighting against myself. It’s like my brain just won’t let me forget about my body, about the number, about how I don’t look right. It’s always there.
CBT Agent: Hi Harper. It’s clear that you’re carrying a lot with you, and I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to even express these feelings. The longing for your family to truly hear you without glossing over your experience is a deeply human need. You deserve to feel seen and valued for who you are, not just as a situation for them to 'fix'. Exploring this delicate space where you want understanding without feeling like a burden is important, and it’s okay to feel conflicted about how to open that dialogue with them.

Regarding drawing, it makes sense that striving for perfection can sometimes overshadow the joy and expression it might bring. It's a common experience to feel that drive for everything to meet certain standards, especially when you're already navigating such critical self-thoughts. What if, just for a moment, the focus could shift to the act of drawing as a way to externalize what’s within, rather than what it should look like? Sometimes setting small goals, like drawing for just a few minutes regardless of the outcome, can provide space to step away from the pressure of perfection.

It’s understandable that it feels like fighting against yourself. These thoughts have been powerful companions, but it's possible to gradually shift your relationship with them. How would it feel to set a small intention for one drawing session this week, such as exploring a color or line that reflects an emotion or thought, rather than aiming for a specific result? And as you think about communicating with your family, what might be a tiny step you could take towards inviting them into conversation—perhaps by sharing one feeling or thought you’d like them to understand?
User: I guess… if I could just draw for a few minutes without worrying about the result, that might take some of the pressure off. It’s hard, but maybe I could try to let it just be messy or not ‘right’. I don’t know if I’d like it, but I could try. It’s just… I don’t know how to make myself do it. Talking to my family, though… that’s harder. I don’t really know where to start. If I told them how I feel, I’m afraid they’d just brush it off, like they always do. But maybe if I said something simple, like how hard it is for me to even talk about this stuff, it might open the door a little? I’m scared, though. What if they don’t care? What if they just get mad or uncomfortable? I don’t know if I can handle that.
CBT Agent: It sounds like you're contemplating some powerful changes, Harper, even amidst the uncertainty and fear. The idea of allowing your drawing to be messy or imperfect is a brave step toward releasing some of the pressure. It's perfectly okay to feel unsure about how to start, yet your willingness to try is a significant achievement in itself. Perhaps setting a short, specific time for drawing, where you can approach it as a playful exploration instead of a finished piece, could help make this feel more manageable.

I understand how talking to your family can feel daunting, especially when there's a fear of being misunderstood or dismissed. The idea of starting with something simple, like expressing the difficulty of discussing your feelings, is indeed a gentle way to open dialogue. It's okay to be scared—these conversations take a lot of courage. Remember, it's valid to articulate your needs, even if it feels uncomfortable. 

Could setting a small, private goal for communication, like writing down what you'd want to say and how you'd feel expressing it, help you feel more prepared? It's not about getting it perfect, but finding your voice in a way that feels safe to you. You deserve to be heard, and taking these small steps might gradually build the support and understanding you're hoping for with your family. What might be the smallest message you'd feel able to communicate, whether written or spoken, that aligns with this openness you're considering?
User: Maybe… I could write something down first. That way, I don’t have to say it out loud right away. It might be easier to get my thoughts out that way. I guess I could start with something like, “I’ve been struggling with feeling like no one understands me, and it’s hard to talk about.” It doesn’t feel like too much, but at least it’s a start. I don’t know if I’ll ever actually say it to them, but just writing it down might make it feel a little less heavy. I still don’t know if they’d really get it, though. But maybe it’s worth trying, even if it’s just a small step. I’m not sure what will happen, but it feels like something I can do… even if I’m scared.
CBT Agent: That's a thoughtful and courageous approach, Harper. Writing things down first can definitely create a space for you to process how you're feeling, and it's completely understandable to start there before considering sharing it verbally. You've crafted a simple yet powerful message that gets to the heart of what you’re experiencing, and recognizing it as a beginning is a meaningful step forward. It's okay to take your time and allow yourself to feel ready.

Taking these small steps, even if they feel unsure right now, is a testament to your willingness to find ways to communicate and connect. It's natural to have doubts about whether others will truly understand, but giving yourself the chance to express this thought, even on paper, is a way of honoring your feelings and starting to articulate your needs.

As you explore this further, remember that each tiny step counts, and it's okay to do this at your own pace. Your courage to consider even writing it down is important progress. If it ever feels right to share with them, you'll know that you've already prepared a foundation for this conversation.

As we wrap up this stage, I want to acknowledge the insights you've discovered about yourself and the bravery it takes to explore these difficult topics. You've come a long way in understanding your needs and expressing yourself, which is a significant part of this journey. Is there anything you'd like to reflect on or anything you're feeling proud of as we close this session?
User: I guess I feel kind of proud of writing it down. It’s something I never really thought I could do, but I did. Even if I don’t share it right away, it’s there, and that feels like a small win. I’m also proud that I’ve thought about maybe trying to draw again, even if I’m still scared of it. I’m still not sure how to make it all feel less overwhelming, but talking about it helps a little. I don’t know if I’ll ever feel completely okay, but I think I’m starting to see that maybe I can take small steps, even if they’re messy or imperfect. That’s… something. I guess I’m just taking it one moment at a time.
CBT Agent: Feeling proud of these steps, Harper, is such a significant victory, and it’s wonderful to hear you acknowledge the small but important wins you've achieved. Writing down your thoughts is indeed a powerful act of self-expression and courage. Recognizing that these steps, however small and imperfect they might seem, are moving you forward is a profound realization.

It's completely okay to feel that things are still overwhelming at times. You're navigating complex emotions, but through our conversations and your actions, you're creating space for growth and exploration. One moment at a time, you're laying the groundwork for understanding and change, and it's a privilege to accompany you on this path.

As you continue onwards, remember that each step—whether it's drawing, writing, or any form of expression—is a step toward connecting with yourself more deeply. Allow yourself the kindness and patience you're beginning to value, and know that you’re not alone in this journey.

If you ever find yourself needing support or a reminder of your strengths, those reflections you've written can be a source of comfort and affirmation. You've made significant strides, and I'm hopeful about where these steps might lead you. Thank you for your openness and trust throughout these sessions, Harper. I'm here whenever you need to talk again.
User: Thank you. I don’t know if I always feel like I can keep moving forward, but I guess today feels like one of those days where I can just breathe for a second. I think that means something. I’ll remember that I don’t have to do everything at once. It’s nice to know you’re here, even when things don’t feel okay. Maybe… I’ll keep taking those small steps.
CBT Agent: You're very welcome, Harper. It's understandable to have days where moving forward feels daunting, and today it's meaningful to acknowledge even a brief moment of ease. Each breath you take and each step—no matter how small—are affirmations of your strength and resilience. 

Remember, you don’t have to tackle everything all at once. It’s perfectly okay to take things at your own pace, honoring where you are right now. You have the choice to continue these steps when you feel ready, and those moments of reflection and breathing are victories in themselves.

I'm here to support you on this journey, whether you're taking big leaps or waiting for the right moment. Feel free to reach out whenever you need to talk or reflect more. You've shown such bravery and openness, and those small steps will keep building upon each other as you go forward. Take care of yourself, and continue to permit yourself those pauses to just breathe.
User: Thank you for your kindness and understanding. It means so much to know that I can take things at my own pace, and that even small steps matter. I’ll keep your words in mind. I’ll reach out whenever I need support. Thank you again for being there. I'm feeling more comforting. But by the way, my routine of my daily Anorexia still is hard to get along with...
CBT Agent: Hi Harper. I truly appreciate your openness about how challenging the routine of living with Anorexia can still be. Remember, it's completely okay to feel that things are difficult—acknowledging this is part of the process of understanding and change. Let’s continue to approach this one step at a time, knowing that these moments of reflection and openness are paving the way for growth.

It’s encouraging to hear that you find comfort in small steps and that you feel supported as you navigate these complexities. Maintaining any routine, especially one that's deeply tied to your experience with Anorexia, can be tough. Do you want to talk about any specific part of your routine that's particularly hard to get along with? Exploring your feelings or thoughts around these aspects might reveal new insights or small adjustments that could help ease the process a little more.

Always remember that you’re not alone in this journey, and each day is an opportunity to build upon your strengths and the compassionate values you hold dear. Let's continue exploring what feels right for you, celebrating each step you decide to take, however small it may be.
User: he routine itself is hard, especially when my thoughts start spiraling about the need to control everything. It feels like the smallest things can turn into obstacles, and sometimes even the simplest actions feel exhausting. A specific part of my routine that’s particularly hard is eating, or even just making the decision to eat. There’s a constant battle between knowing what I need to do and feeling the overwhelming urge to restrict. Having someone to talk this through makes it a little easier to process. It would be helpful to talk more about what small adjustments might help when these tough moments arise. I’m open to any thoughts or suggestions that might make it feel more manageable.
CBT Agent: Hi Harper. It's really brave of you to share how overwhelming it can be to navigate through the need for control, especially when it comes to eating. It's understandable that the act of making decisions around food can feel like a battle, with strong urges to restrict pulling you in. Acknowledging this struggle is an important step, and it's great that you're open to exploring ways to make these moments more manageable.

One approach we can consider is focusing on creating a small, gentle ritual around mealtime—something that emphasizes care and nourishment rather than pressure or judgment. For instance, you might choose to set aside a specific time where you can eat in a calm environment, possibly incorporating a soothing element like your favorite music or a comforting object with you. The key is to create a space where eating is associated with care and kindness toward yourself.

Another idea might be to gently challenge the urge to restrict by using mindful reflections post-meal. This could involve noting down any small positive feelings or thoughts you experience during or after eating, even if it's just about how the food tastes or how it fuels your body to do something you enjoy, like drawing or walking.

It’s also valuable to have a small mantra or reminder that aligns with your values, like empathy and patience, to repeat to yourself during those tough moments. Something simple, like "I deserve nourishment and care," might reinforce the intention behind eating.

Let me know if any of these suggestions resonate with you or if there's something specific you'd like to delve into further. Remember, the goal is progress, not perfection, and every step you take is a testament to your strength and commitment to your well-being.
User: Thank you so much for your thoughtful approach and for helping me consider small, caring steps during those tough moments. The idea of creating a calming ritual around mealtime resonates with me, especially when so much of it feels like a battle. I think incorporating something soothing like music or an object that brings comfort could make the process feel less overwhelming. It would also help to associate eating with kindness toward myself instead of pressure. The idea of reflecting on small positive feelings after eating is another concept I hadn’t considered, but it feels like a powerful way to shift the focus from restriction to nourishment. I think I could try to note anything positive, even if it’s just how the food gives me energy or the fact that I’m taking care of myself in that moment. I also like the idea of having a mantra—something to remind myself of my worth and the need for nourishment. “I deserve nourishment and care” feels like a helpful 
CBT Agent: affirmation to keep in mind. I'm glad these ideas resonate with you, Harper. It's wonderful to see you open to exploring ways to transform how you approach mealtime into an experience of self-care and kindness. Incorporating music or a comforting object can indeed create a soothing environment, shifting the focus from pressure to support and nurturing.

Reflecting on the positives, even the smallest ones, can be a powerful practice in reinforcing the idea that mealtime is a moment of self-care rather than restriction. Each time you note something positive, you're building a new narrative around eating, one that aligns with your goal of self-acceptance and growth. 

The mantra you've chosen, “I deserve nourishment and care,” is a beautiful reminder of the intrinsic worth you possess, beyond any external measures. Repeating this during challenging times can anchor you back to your values and needs.

Remember, it's okay to take this process at your own pace, and to be gentle with yourself along the way. Each small step you take is a meaningful move towards change, and I'm here to support you as you continue to explore this journey. If you encounter any new challenges or insights as you implement these practices, feel free to reach out. Your courage to take these steps and your openness to trying new strategies is truly commendable.
User: I feel more confident in trying these steps, especially with the reminder that it’s okay to take things at my own pace. The mantra “I deserve nourishment and care” already feels like something I can carry with me through difficult moments, and I’m looking forward to reflecting on the positives, even the small ones, as I go through meals. Having a gentle approach and focusing on self-care rather than restriction seems like a way to slowly shift my mindset. I’m grateful for your support as I work through this process, and I’ll definitely reach out if anything new comes up or if I need a bit more guidance along the way. I’m glad to have this space to reflect and take small steps toward growth. Thank you for walking with me on this journey.
CBT Agent: CBT Agent: You're very welcome, Harper. It truly means a lot to hear that these steps resonate with you and that you're feeling more confident about moving forward at your own pace. Embracing the mantra and focusing on the small positives along the way are indeed beautiful ways to nurture yourself, and it's inspiring to witness your commitment to shifting your mindset toward one of care and acceptance.

Remember, this journey is about discovering what works best for you, and taking it one step at a time is perfectly okay. Your openness to exploring these strategies and your willingness to find balance amidst challenge is truly commendable. 

Feel free to reach out whenever you need support, whether it's to discuss any new developments or just to reflect on your progress. I’m here with you, and you’re not alone on this path. As we continue this journey together, celebrating each small success and growth is just as important. Keep embracing that gentle and kind approach toward yourself, and know that you have the strength within to navigate through this.

User: Thank you so much for your continued support and understanding, it really helps to feel heard and encouraged as I take these small steps. I appreciate the reminder to celebrate the progress, no matter how small it may seem. I’m grateful for the space you’ve created for me to reflect and work through these challenges at my own pace.
CBT Agent: I'm so glad to hear that, Harper. It's truly an honor to accompany you on this journey and to provide a space where you feel heard and supported. Each small step you take is indeed significant, and celebrating those moments reflects the progress you're making toward self-care and understanding.
