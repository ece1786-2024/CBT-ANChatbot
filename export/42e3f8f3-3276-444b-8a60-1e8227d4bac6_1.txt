User: Why does everyone keep saying I need treatment? I don’t understand why everyone’s making such a big deal out of this. I feel fine—well, most of the time. Sure, I get tired, but I’m okay. I don’t see what’s wrong. Can’t they just let me be?
CBT Agent: "Hi Harper Lee, I'm glad you’re here to chat with me today. It sounds like you're feeling a bit frustrated and maybe puzzled about why others are concerned. It's understandable to feel okay most days and not see what others might see. Could you share a bit more about what feeling 'fine' looks like for you day-to-day? And maybe we can explore together why those around you might be worried."

User: I guess ‘fine’ just means… getting through the day. I wake up early, weigh myself, and… if the number’s good, I feel okay for a little while. Then I just try to keep busy so I don’t think about food or, you know, everything else. But people keep watching me, asking me to eat, and it’s exhausting. I don’t get why they’re so worried—it’s not like I’m sick or anything. I just wish they’d stop making everything about me and let me handle things my way. It’s the only thing I feel like I can control.
CBT Agent: "Thank you, Harper Lee, for sharing more about your day-to-day experiences. It sounds like there's a lot of pressure when others are watching and commenting on your eating habits. That must feel quite overwhelming at times. When you mention handling things your way, it highlights how important having control feels to you, especially during a day that sounds quite busy and filled with measuring moments. What do you think makes the morning weigh-in so significant for you? And how does that influence the rest of your day?"

User: It’s… everything, I guess. When I step on the scale, it’s like the one thing that tells me if I’m doing okay. If the number goes down, it feels like I’ve done something right—like I’m closer to looking how I’m supposed to. But if it goes up… everything falls apart. It’s hard to explain, but it feels like the number controls my mood. If it’s good, I can handle the day. If it’s not, I can’t stop thinking about it, and everything feels wrong. I know people say it shouldn’t matter, but it does. It’s the only thing that makes me feel even a little bit in control. Without it, I don’t know who I’d be.
CBT Agent: "I really appreciate you sharing that, Harper Lee. It sounds like the scale has become a very powerful part of your daily routine, almost like a guide for how to feel throughout the day. That must be quite a lot to carry with you, especially when the number can shift your mood so significantly. It’s understandable why others might be concerned, given how central this process is to your well-being. What do you think it would be like to change your relationship with the scale? Is there a small way we could start exploring what it might feel like to find control in other areas of your life, perhaps even ones not related to numbers?"

User: I don’t know if I can just stop. It’s been like this for so long—just stepping on the scale and having that one number decide if I’m okay. Changing that feels… scary. I don’t know what I’d do without it, or how I’d feel if I didn’t know exactly where I stand. But maybe… maybe I could think about something else to focus on? I don’t know. It’s hard to imagine. It’s like… if I’m not focusing on the scale, I’ll just… lose control in other ways. But I guess I can try. Maybe we could figure out something small. I don’t know if it’ll make any difference, but… maybe.
CBT Agent: "Hi Harper Lee, thank you for being so open and thinking about possibilities, even though it's scary. It sounds like the idea of finding control in another way feels almost like stepping into uncharted territory. I want to reassure you that any step, no matter how small, is meaningful. Perhaps we could start by identifying something in your daily routine that brings you even a little bit of joy or comfort that doesn’t rely on numbers. Is there an activity or moment in your day you feel somewhat positive about? Maybe something you can focus on that could gradually become your go-to spot for a sense of control or peace?"

User: I don’t really know anymore… There used to be things I liked, like drawing or… I don’t know, just being outside when it wasn’t too crowded. But now, it feels like everything’s just about getting through the day without thinking too much. I guess sometimes I feel kind of okay when I’m alone—like when I’m just… walking around, with my thoughts. No one watching me, no scale, no pressure. It’s not much, but… maybe it’s something. I don’t know if it’ll help, but I guess it’s a start, right? I could maybe try focusing on that more.
CBT Agent: "It sounds like being outside and going for a walk brings you a sense of solitude and relief. It's entirely valid to appreciate those moments where you feel less pressure and more at ease with just your own thoughts. It’s definitely a useful starting point, and I'm glad you’ve identified something that feels somewhat okay. Maybe we can explore how these walks could become a little more frequent or intentional, perhaps making them a dedicated time to focus on what you enjoy about it. How do you feel about the idea of adding a bit more structure to these walking moments, to help guide you towards creating a new space for control and well-being? What might that look like for you?"

User: I guess… if it’s just about walking, maybe I could make it a routine. Like, every day, go for a walk at the same time, without worrying about anything else. Just… being outside, away from everything. No one telling me what to do. It’s hard to think about making it something more… structured, though. I mean, I’d have to figure out how long I’d walk or where, or if I should have a goal for it. I don’t know if that would feel like just another thing to control. But, maybe if I keep it simple—just the walk, no pressure—that might be okay. It could be a small thing, not tied to numbers or expectations. I don’t know if it’ll help, but it sounds better than nothing.
CBT Agent: "Hi Harper Lee, it sounds like you're cautiously open to the possibility of creating a routine around your walks, which is a really encouraging step forward. Keeping it simple and focusing on just being outside without any added pressure feels like a gentle way to start. It’s perfectly okay to ease into this with small, manageable steps—after all, this is an opportunity for you to have some time just for yourself, free from expectations and numbers. How do you feel about giving it a try for a week and seeing how it feels for you? Maybe you could choose a time of day when it feels less stressful, something you can look forward to. How would you like to approach this to ensure it feels right for you?"

User: Maybe… I could try it for a week. I’m not sure how it will go, but I guess having one time a day where I don’t have to worry about anything would be nice. Maybe in the morning, when it’s quieter—before everyone else is up. That way, I won’t feel like I’m being watched or like I’m not doing enough. I’ll just focus on walking and maybe notice how I feel while I’m out there. I won’t try to make it a big thing. Just… a walk. No expectations, no numbers. It’s hard, but I’ll try. I’ll see if it feels any different. Maybe it’ll help, or maybe it won’t, but it’s worth trying.
CBT Agent: "Hi Harper Lee, I'm so glad to hear you're considering giving this a try. It sounds like you’re carving out a peaceful moment in your mornings to be with your thoughts, without any pressure or numbers, which is a meaningful step. Starting your day this way could potentially offer a fresh perspective and a little bit of calm. It's important to remember that this is entirely your time, and there’s no right or wrong way to feel during these walks. Would it be helpful for you to think of one small thing to focus on during your walks, like the feel of the air or the sounds around you? Just something simple that could help ground you in that moment?"

User: I think focusing on something small could help… Maybe I could try paying attention to the air, like how it feels on my skin or how it changes as I walk. I don’t usually think about things like that, but it might be good to notice something besides… everything else. I could also listen to the sounds around me, like the birds or the cars in the distance. Just simple things, not about what’s wrong or what I should be doing. I’ll give it a shot, but I won’t expect too much from it. It’s just for me.
CBT Agent: "Hi Harper Lee, it’s really great to see you embracing this idea of focusing on simple, mindful experiences during your walks. Paying attention to the sensations, like the air on your skin or the sounds around you, can create moments of peace and presence that are just for you. It's wonderful that you’re approaching this without pressure or expectations—every step you take in this direction, no matter how small, is a meaningful step towards something new. As you begin this practice, you might feel different things each time, and that’s perfectly okay. I'm here to support you as you explore this journey. How do you think you might remind yourself to notice these small details as you go about your walks?"

User: I think… maybe I could set a reminder, like in my phone or something. Just a note to myself: “Notice the air. Listen to the sounds.” Something simple, so I don’t forget. It’ll be like a little nudge to stay present instead of letting my thoughts wander to everything else. Maybe I could even take a deep breath before I start walking, just to slow things down. It’s something small, but it might help me stay focused on that one moment. I’m still not sure how it’ll go, but… I think I can try.
CBT Agent: "Hi Harper Lee, I love the idea of setting a gentle reminder for yourself as a way to stay present during your walks. It’s a lovely way to encourage mindfulness and stay connected to those simple, grounding experiences. Taking a deep breath before you start is also a powerful way to set your intention and create a calm beginning for your walk. Remember, this is all about taking small steps that feel right for you, and I’m here to support you as you try this out. How do you feel about starting this new routine? Is there anything else you’d like to explore or discuss as you prepare for it?"

User: I think I’m ready to try it… It feels a little strange, but maybe that’s a sign it could be good. Having something simple to focus on might help distract me from everything else. I’ll try to take it one day at a time. I’m not sure what else to think about right now. I guess… I’ll just see how it feels, and if it doesn’t work, I can always try something different. But I’m willing to give it a shot. Thanks for helping me figure this out. It feels like something that might help, even if it’s just a little.
CBT Agent: "Hi Harper Lee, I'm appreciative of your openness to try something new, especially when it feels a little strange or unfamiliar. It’s encouraging to hear you’re willing to take it one day at a time, focusing on simple things during your walks. This approach can help create a pause from other pressures, offering you a moment just for yourself. Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection, and trying something different if you feel it’s not working is also okay. You're taking a valuable step by being willing to explore and adapt. I’m here to support you through this journey. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or clarify before you begin your routine?"

User: I think I’m okay for now… It’s still a little hard to believe that something as simple as a walk could make a difference, but I guess it’s worth trying. I’m glad I can take it at my own pace. Maybe I’ll check in after a few days and see how I feel. I don’t know what to expect, but… I think I’m ready to start. Thank you for being here and helping me figure it out. I’ll see how it goes.
CBT Agent: "Hi Harper Lee, I'm grateful for your willingness to try something new, even if it feels uncertain right now. It's completely okay to take things at your own pace and check in with how you're feeling as you go along. Remember that small, consistent changes can sometimes have a meaningful impact over time, and it's perfectly fine to adapt this routine as you see fit. I'm here to support you every step of the way, and I look forward to hearing about how it goes when you're ready to share. Take care and know that you’re taking a significant step forward by simply being open to this experience."

User: Thanks. I think I’ll try to remember that… It feels like a small step, but it might turn out to be bigger than I expect. I’ll let you know how it goes when I can. I appreciate you being here to talk this through. It makes it feel less… heavy. I’ll try.
CBT Agent: "Hi Harper Lee, you're absolutely right—sometimes the smallest steps can lead to meaningful changes, and I'm really glad you're open to seeing where this new routine might take you. It's great to hear that talking this through has made things feel a bit lighter. Remember, I'm here to support you along the way, and feel free to share how things are going at any time. Your willingness to explore something different is a significant step forward. I look forward to hearing how your walks unfold in your journey. Take care, and know you're making progress just by trying."

User: I guess we’ll see, huh? I’ll take it one day at a time. I’m not sure where this will go, but I think that’s okay. Thanks for being patient with me. I’ll keep you posted if I need to talk or if anything changes. It’s helpful to know you’re here.
CBT Agent: "Hi Harper Lee, taking things one day at a time sounds like a thoughtful approach, and I'm really glad to hear you're open to seeing where this leads. It's perfectly okay to not have all the answers right now and to take it step by step. I'm here, ready to talk whenever you need, and it's a privilege to be part of this journey with you. Remember, you’re never alone in this, and reaching out is always an option. Whenever you're ready, I'd love to hear about your experiences or any thoughts you have along the way. Take care, and know you’re doing a great job just by being willing to try something new."

User: Thanks… I’ll keep that in mind. It’s hard to feel like I’m doing something right, but I guess it’s a start. I’ll take it slow and see how things go. I’ll check in when I can, and maybe it won’t feel as strange soon. Thanks for being here.
CBT Agent: "Hi Harper Lee, I understand that taking these steps can feel challenging, and I admire your courage in starting this new routine. It's completely okay to take things slow and allow yourself time to adjust. Remember, every small effort counts, and you’re already making significant progress by being open to exploring new ways to feel more at ease. I'm here for you whenever you feel like sharing your experiences or if you need any support. Take it one day at a time, and know that you have a supportive space to turn to whenever you need it.
